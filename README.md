# ***digital ampelography***
a repository for digital ampelographic resources

under development, more soon!

this repository contains outline data for grapevine leaves that can be used for procrustean landmark analysis and orthogonal decomposition to explore a high resolution morphospace for grapevine leaves. some currently posted resources:

`landmarks.jpg`: a diagram of the 87 landmarks used in this analysis  

`data`: folder that contains polyline trace files for the ***blade*** and ***veins*** as well as ***landmarks*** for each leaf type analyzed   

`ampelography.ipynb`: jupyter notebook to interpolate the same numbers of corresponding pseudolandmarks between leaves and create visualizations of ampelographic traits as described in the Cornell edition of Pierre Galet's *A Practical Ampelography*  

`images`: folder that contains visualization outputs of ampelographic traits according to Galet superimposed on leaf outline data  

`landmarks`: folder that contains interpolated, scaled, rotated, and translated pseudolandmark data  

`morphospace.ipynb`: jupyter notebook that performs procrustes alignment followed by principal component analysis and reconstruction of a theoretical morphospace based on eigenleaf data
